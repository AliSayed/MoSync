The MoSync PIM API is complex. This document intends to provide an overview of how PIM data is stored.

First, there's the List. There are only a few different Lists in a system, like Contacts and Events. For now, MoSync supports only Contacts.

A List is composed of Items and Fields.

A Field is a type of data. Examples include Name, Address, Phone number. Each Field has a DataType, which specifies how the Field's data is stored. For example, Phone number is stored as a String, while Address is stored as a StringArray.

An Item is a collection of Values. For example, in the Contacts List, an Item would represent a single Contact.

A Value is the actual data. Each Value is associated with a Field. Each Field in an Item can have one or more Values.
An Item is not required to have a Value for each possible Field.

Each Value can have Attributes, which are boolean flags that give further meaning to the Value.
