2008-12-18: Version 2.0 beta 1
-----------------------------------

New Stuff
---------

* Eclipse-based IDE. A version of the popular Integrated Development Environment, specialized for
  MoSync.
* New platform: Windows Mobile. Versions supported include 4.1, 5.0 and 6.0.
* ARM recompiler. Speeds up execution on Symbian and WindowsMobile platforms by up to 10
  times.
* Library additions:
    - MAUtil::Graphics library with transformation and clipping stacks.
    - MTXml. A streaming, efficient XML parser.
    - MinUI. An example of a minimalistic GUI library.
    - MAFS. An implementation of the stdio buffered file access API (fopen() et. al), built
      on top of MoSync's cross-platform Store system.
    - Native framebuffer access. Write your own graphics renderers, or port framebuffer-based
      applications to MoSync.
    - Generic Connection library for Moblet users.
    - MAUtil::Downloader and BuffDownloader. Easy-to-use APIs for downloading files from the Internet.
* Touchscreen support.
* Support for sending text SMS.
* Better debugging. Call stacks and expanded panic codes help you find
  errors faster. A communications link from the emulator to the IDE lets
  an application log messages directly to the IDE.
* New syscalls for debugging and error reporting: maReportCallStack(), maPanic().

Other notable changes
---------------------

* Documentation overhaul. New look, new tutorials.
* New look and feel of the MoSync emulator.
* Bug-fixes to Dead Code Elimination. The GCC torture-test suite now runs without failure,
  except for programs using some gcc extensions. See Known Issues below.
* Enhanced maLoadProgram(), supporting reloading of the original program.
* MAUtil::HttpGet has been removed.
* MAUtil::Stream, a little-used and inefficient character stream library, has been removed.
* Bugfix: basic drawing operations on Series 60 2nd edition, FP3, now work correctly.
* HTTP headers, handled by maHttpSetRequestHeader and maHttpGetResponseHeader,
  are now case-insensitive on all platforms.
* Extensive improvements to the profile database.

Compiler-breaking changes
----------------

* Spelling correction: STERR_NONEXISTANT -> STERR_NONEXISTENT
* MAUtil::ConnectionListener changed name to ConnListener.
* When compiling in debug mode, the preprocessor macro MOSYNCDEBUG will be
  pre-defined. You cannot then define it yourself.

Known Issues
------------

* The installer may fail to add %MOSYNCDIR%\bin to the environment variable PATH.
  This will cause the compiler to fail, saying
  "xgcc: installation problem, cannot exec `cc1plus': No such file or directory".
  To resolve this problem, add \mosync\bin to your PATH manually.
* Sometimes, compile errors aren't properly removed during a build, so that an application
  will fail to launch even if no errors occured. This can be worked around by manually removing
  the errors from the "problems" tab next to the IDE console.
* The ARM recompiler improves performance at the cost of memory. Extraordinarily large
  applications will fail to launch on devices that don't have enough memory.
* The following GCC extensions are not supported and will result in undefined behaviour:
  * the Complex built-in type
  * trampolines
  * pointers to labels
* Using socket connections with port 13 on the Sony-Ericsson Z1010 causes the
  system to shut down with the message "Network failure". Other low ports may
  also exhibit this problem, so use port numbers above 1024 to avoid problems.
* The Bluetooth system in the MoSync emulator doesn't yet work with any stack except for
  Microsoft's. If you have a Broadcom stack/chipset, you can work around this
  by adding a Microsoft-compatible Bluetooth dongle to your system.
* Some SonyEricsson phones will cut off the last second or so of any sound
  played. Work around this by adding some silence to the end of all your sounds.
* Occasionally incorrect error line number information. Can be improved by
  turning off compiler optimizations (add "-O0" to "Additional gcc switches").
* The syscall maCreateImageRaw doesn't give the expected output on some
  SonyEricsson phones when the source image has transparency.
* On Symbian and Windows Mobile, maPlatformRequest() is unable to start voice
  calls.
* maSoundPlay on Windows Mobile can only play wave files.
* Keypad lock functions on Windows Mobile isn't available.
* Framebuffer functions are slow on J2ME phones.

Key Map
-------

The Windows runtime uses some of the keyboard's keys to simulate a phone's
  keypad.
The mapping to MAK codes is as follows:

MAK_0 to MAK_9: numeric keypad, or the main number keys.
MAK_0 is also mapped to the spacebar.
MAK_LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN: arrow keys.
MAK_FIRE: Any of the Ctrl keys.
MAK_STAR: numeric Multiply, or the comma key.
MAK_GRID: numeric Divide, or the V key.
MAK_SOFTLEFT: left Shift key.
MAK_SOFTRIGHT: right Shift key.
MAK_CLEAR: Delete or Backspace.


2007-11-30: Version 1.0
-----------------------------------

New Stuff
---------

* Native Symbian Series 60 support for both 2nd and 3rd Editions.
  Compared to Java, this offers improved performance, more features,
  and a significantly smaller memory footprint.
* MAUI: A Graphical User Interface library.
* The Windows runtime now features an interactive phone model.


Known Issues (Please read)
--------------------------

* On Symbian phones, problems may occur if an earlier version of the 
MoSync runtime have been installed. Therefore you should uninstall it
through the application manager manually before installing a new version of
MoSync (or any application using MoSync). The MoSync runtime will also appear
as an application in the application menu, but can't run on its own.
