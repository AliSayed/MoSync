Newlib is an implementation of the standard libc, mostly written by Red Hat.
It's designed for embedded systems, and so has a relatively small footprint.
The downside is that it doesn't support some of the rarer features that you could find in GNU or BSD libc.

The MoSync version of Newlib is a replacement for (and source-compatible with) MAStd,
MoSync's first, tiny and rather non-compliant libc.

Compared to MAStd, Newlib has many new, useful features, for example:
* Full stdio implementation (fopen, printf, scanf, opendir et. al), connected to MoSync's native file API.
* Complete string and wide-char support.
* Advanced math functions, like atan, log10 and sinh.
* Quick sort.

Some functions are not available, such as:
* The entire locale/iconv system (because it eats a huge amount of memory).
* Anything that deals with other processes, such as system(), fork(), exec() and popen().
* pthreads.

Some functions are available, but with limitations:
* getenv() and putenv() cannot read from or write to the external environment.
* open() and mkdir() have octal permissions arguments. These are ignored in MoSync, as its virtual
  filesystem does not support permissions.

These lists are not exhaustive.
