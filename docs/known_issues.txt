The MoSync runtime for Symbian Series 60, 3rd edition relies on an embedded program to access the Location API. There is a bug on all devices running Symbian OS v9.1 and v9.2 that affects MoSync applications.

The embedded program is shared by all MoSync applications on a device. It is installed by the first MoSync application to be installed on the device. The bug is the following: whenever a MoSync application is UN-installed, it also removes the embedded program, rendering all remaining MoSync applications unusable.

A workaround is to reinstall any one of the remaining MoSync applications. This will cause the embedded program to also be reinstalled.

TODO: Compile a list of device models affected by this bug.
