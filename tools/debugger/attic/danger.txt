execution is stopped.
Normal flow of events:
user commands -exec-step.
:begin
-> step
<- ack
-> getRegs
<- ack
<- regs
-> ack
maybe goto :begin
output end-stepping-range

original error: failed _ASSERT(sAckCallback == NULL) in sendPacket()
execution is running.
abnormal flow:
<- stopped
-> ack
-> getRegs	# by breakpointHit() or equivalent
user commands whatever, like read-memory
-> getMem	# breaks here with the original error

to reproduce:
-break-insert endless/endless.c:9
-exec-continue
-test-wait
-exec-step
-test-wait
-exec-step
-test-wait
-exec-step


corrected flow:
-> getRegs
user command halted until stub connection is idle
<- ack
<- regs
-> ack
# stub connection is now idle
-> getMem	# user command resumed
<- ack
<- data
-> ack
output data	# hooray
