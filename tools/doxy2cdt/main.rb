# This tool converts a doxygen XML index to a similar index that the CDT dynamic
# help system can understand. The XML index used for input is generated by
# doxygen when setting the "XML_OUTPUT = yes" option in the Doxyfile.
#
# The reason for not using XSLT is that some of the attributes requires
# simple text transformations. For example the href attribute in <topic>.
