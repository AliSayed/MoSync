	LIFO stack

Stacks are a type of container adaptors, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from the end of the container.

Stacks are implemented as containers adaptors, which are classes that use an encapsulated object of a specific container class as its underlying container, providing a specific set of member functions to access its elements. Elements are pushed/popped from the "back" of the specific container, which is known as the top of the stack.
