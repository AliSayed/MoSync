MoSync introduces a few new terms, and uses others in a new way. Here they are explained. 	

=== **Device** ===
A model of machine that can execute arbitrary programs.
=== **Platform** ===
  An operating system, or version thereof, that is used by one or more devices. Examples include J2ME, Series 60 and Windows Mobile.
=== **Runtime** ===
An implementation of MoSync. Platforms supported by MoSync have different runtimes.
=== **Syscall** ===
System Call - a function that is implemented, in code native to each platform, by the MoSync runtime.
=== **Handle** ===
An identifier to an object managed by the runtime. There are different types of handles, not interchangable.
=== **Resource / object** ===
A piece of data managed by the runtime. Types include Image, Media (sound/video) and Data (aka Binary). Each resource is identified by a Handle. The words "resource" and "object" are used interchangably in MoSync's documentation.

Resources can be compiled with the rest of the program and loaded at startup. They can also be created and destroyed at runtime.
=== **Placeholder** ===
A resource handle that doesn't identify any resource. It is used in the creation of new resources.
=== **Event** ===
MoSync Events deliver notification of keypresses, stylus movements and the results of asynchronous operations like networking and Bluetooth scans.
=== **Connection** ===
A serial connection to a remote machine, identified by a Handle. There are different types of connections, including TCP, HTTP and Bluetooth.
