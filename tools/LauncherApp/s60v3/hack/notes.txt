For 3rd edition runtime exe hacking to work, one must do the following:
*Compile with:  abld build gcce urel
*Use a UID in the E range. The A range will somehow optimize away the cleartext UID that we need.

Then it works with logging both on and off. I haven't tested other configs like guido or wifi, but I'm optimistic that those should work as well. We'll certainly find out if they don't, once we try to install them.
