Bug: first function in the file is considered main, regardless of its name.

Problem: floating-point operators are allowed by the compiler but caught by the assembler, making it difficult to find the error.
11:06 2006-04-07
This concerns automatic conversions too.

Bug: it can happen that 4-byte words are not 4-byte aligned, making the s60 vm crash when accessing them.
15:28 2006-04-06
Workaround: change all "align 2" to "align 4" in the .S file.
13:10 2006-04-19
We should specify that all words in PIPE must be aligned.

13:10 2006-04-19
The assembler doesn't handle escape sequences properly. For example, "a\"b" becomes "a\0b".

shared/misc.c/atoi() has overflow bugs. fix it.

16:22 2006-04-21
shared/print.c/d2a() has a rounding bug. fix it.

Compiler requires main to return int. It should require it to return void instead, since MA main should never return.
10:56 2006-05-15
Alternatively, returning from main could invoke Exit().

Bug in resource compiler: a .lst file with no .res, only a .end, will produce an invalid resource of type 0.

13:28 2006-06-09
Problem in assembler: static, uninitialized variables cause an error. static consts are ok, I think static initialized are also ok.

Write program to text pixel-perfectness of plot, line and rect drawing functions.
