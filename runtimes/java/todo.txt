Try making the data section a byte array, accessed by a ByteArrayDataIOStream. Might speed stuff up.

read/writeMemBytes() can be optimized by writing ints instead of bytes wherever possible.

Hashmap for sockets!

Optimize loading of RT_IMAGE with LimitedLengthInputStream.

14:54 2006-11-17
Optimize ConnRead.

Create an optimized int FIFO Queue for use with BufferedKeyEvents.

Let it be a circular buffer, avoiding memcpys and allocs.

Bugtest: setClipForFullScreenNeeded @ SE K700(ic)
Bugfix & test: fullScreenInPaint @ SE Z1010, P900, P908, P910(ica), Motorola A1000
	SE Z1010 does not display the bug; unfixed version works well.
Low priority, Bugfix & test: BluetoothRfcommInputStream @ Nokia 6670, 9300, 6260, 7610, 6620, 6600, 9500
Low priority, Bugcheck: MaxCommunnicationVolume @ Samsung SGH-E720
Bugfix & test: inaccessibleFirstRow @ Samsung E710, E715, P400, E105, X450, X427, SGH-E700
Bugfix & test: losesFullScreen @ Samsung SGH-D500

16:47 2007-01-02
Bugs the MoSync developer needs to be aware of:
maxUrlLength @ Samsung SGH-E720
inaccessibleFirstRow @ Samsung E710, E715, P400, E105, X450, X427, SGH-E700
	Results in an odd screen size.

16:50 2007-01-02
Bugs we will need to be aware of in a possible future:
needsNokiaUiForSystemAlerts
drawRgbOrigin @ SE K800i, Mylo, W900(i), W800, Z1010, P900, K700(ic), P910(ica), Samsung SGH-D900
	Only appears when using Graphics.translate(), which we don't.

Many key events at the same time will cause the latter events to be lagged. I don't know if this is a bug in J2ME itself, SE's implementation, or the MoSync runtime.

Very weird bug when trying to run a re-downloaded program in OtaLoad.
14:59 2007-03-27
Probably due to IDL differences.

Concatenate "program" and "resources" for java packages to enable some improvement of splash-screen post-loading code.

Subclasses cost extra, since they get a reference to their parent object by default in Java. Move subclasses that don't need to be subs out into their own files.

Get rid of as many NEWs as possible. For example, make static seekable streams in BinaryInterface.
11:34 2007-06-25
Prioritize things that are run a lot. BinaryInterface isn't called upon all that often, in a well-designed program.

System.getProperty ("microedition.platform");
Class.forName("com.nokia.mid.ui.FullCanvas");

10:40 2007-12-19
Use In/outputStream.close() a bit more... than nothing. :)

18:00 2008-07-28
Static java: fix exit and error handling.

Use Bluetooth system properties to allow for more asynchronous discovery. eg. "bluetooth.sd.trans.max".
