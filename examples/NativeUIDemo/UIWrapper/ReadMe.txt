This is an example of a class library that wraps the MoSync
widget system for native UI on Android and iPhone.

You can use this library in your own applications, and
extend it as needed, but be aware that this is an example
library, and that it is not fully documented and does not 
fully support all features of the widget system.

For the full documentation of the MoSync native UI, see
the documentation on the web site at www.mosync.com, and
also the include file IX_WIDGET.h.
